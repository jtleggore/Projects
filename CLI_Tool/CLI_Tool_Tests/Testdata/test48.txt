Penn State Harrisburg
 Save your money for a college more worth while. This place doesn't care about the safety or 
 well-being of anyone but those in their interests. If you need campus police, good luck,
 they're "busy" and when you see them on campus, they're literally just hanging out. If you're 
 looking for a party scene, go somewhere else. This small campus is in a residential neighborhood 
 and is nothing like main campus. But, if you want to be awakened in the middle of the night to
 screaming and other loud noises, the dorms here are where it's at. If you're looking for quality 
 education, this place is a joke. They care more about pushing agendas than they do educating you 
 in what you're paying for. If you don't want to be just another number and want more of a 
 personalized approach, definitely go somewhere else. This place sucks.
