Slippery Rock University 
 Slippery Rock University has some of the best and most helpful professors I have ever met as this is 
 my second time around going to college. With the lowest tuition rates in the state and the value you
 get from learning from the current professors (if a student takes advantage of what they can learn) 
 is unmatched anywhere else. While Slippery Rock is not the biggest town, it is only about an hour 
 from Pittsburgh and 1/2 an hour from Butler where more shopping, restaurants, and fun exist. 
 Slippery Rock University is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to improve their knowledge
 and success in life!
