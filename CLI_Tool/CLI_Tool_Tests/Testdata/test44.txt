Indiana University of Pennsylvania
 If you are from the area, than IUP may be the school for you. If you are not anywhere near the 
 Pittsburgh area, than i strongly encourage you to look for another school. Most people go home
 on the weekends since 85% of the freshman class are from the suburbs of Pittsburgh. The people 
 here kinda suck. The parties here are boring and trashy. The frats are rude and the sororities 
 are trashy. The professors never know what they are talking about ( no wonder why the tuition
 is so cheap). Even though the tuition is cheap, which is what attracts most people, it is not 
 worth coming here to further your academic career. Most professors are very un-professional 
 and you will question how they received a college degree. Don't make the mistake that I did 
 by choosing IUP as your school.
