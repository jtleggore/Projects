Harrisburg Area Community College - Harrisburg
I really enjoyed being able to choose to have such a flexible schedule when enrolling in upcoming semester
 classes. I love the fact that there are not just college degree options offered, but continuing education
 credit hours and certificates are some of the many options as well! This college also has many articulation 
 and continuing education programs; meaning a lot of Bachelor's level colleges will take HACC credits and 
 ensures smooth transfers, wile saving thousands of dollars! Harrisburg Area Community College is affordable,
 local, and a wonderful opportunity overall for many adults of all ages to jumpstart their careers and 
 education! I do not see a need to make any changes at this time.
