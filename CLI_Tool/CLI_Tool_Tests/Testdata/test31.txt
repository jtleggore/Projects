Penn State 
 Penn State is a great school with plenty of opportunities to get involved, great
 laboratories, and an overall great campus life experience. The campus is huge, with
 hundreds of clubs that you could participate in and get involved. The campus 
 atmosphere is so relaxing, with plenty of nature everywhere you look.
As a science major, I experience many classes involving laboratories, and the equipment 
that I use is very up to date and exciting to use.
Most of the professors here are genuine, and care about your success in their classes.
 However, you do need to put in the effort if you want to do well.
The only concern I have with Penn State is regarding their safety in regards to campus.
 There are many sexual conducts that we receive alerts for, and we even had an armed
 robbery a few weeks ago. I would feel safer if Penn State administration would address
 these safety issues and try to prevent them from occurring. Overall, Penn State is a
 good option for those considering college!
