University of St. Thomas - Minnesota
 The class sizes are good - typically less than 25 people per class, so it is
 easier to form connections with your professors. St Thomas is diverse but not
 inclusive. They have quite a few students of color, and have resources on campus
 for these students, but most of the non-students of color and some of the 
 professors are very passive aggressive towards POC students.
