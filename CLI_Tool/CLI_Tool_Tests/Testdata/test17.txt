Michigan State University
 Michigan State has a somewhat diverse student population. There is something 
 for everyone! theres a wide variety of options as far as academic programs,
 organizations/clubs, on campus activities, and social opportunities. There's
 various employment opportunities on campus and ways to connect with staff/faculty
 for various opportunities for academics and employment. I enjoyed my time at MSU 
 and definitely recommend this university.
