Louisiana State University - Shreveport (Grad)
 I am currently a 1st year graduate student enrolled in the 100% online program. I have really enjoyed my 
 experience at LSUS so far. I feel really supported there and I also feel like, besides changes and
 interruptions due to COVID, everyone responds pretty quickly to questions and concerns.
