University of Pennsylvania 
 The best thing about Penn is definitely the people or the students. All
 students are motivated to do well, but also passionate about multiple 
 interests. The amount of diversity you encounter is tremendous. It is the
 perfect blend of a campus life located in a city and the perfect example 
 of a school with well-rounded students. Penn is also known for its research 
 and professional resources. No matter what career you are considering Penn is
 the place to be. It is the school with the highest percentage of students with 
 internships. There are numerous opportunities to get involved in research. One 
 complaint might be that the culture is too pre-professional, but Penn has a great
 liberal arts program as well. It has some of the best programs in linguistics,
 psychology, and urban studies. Penn is a campus where innovation and research are
 encouraged and fulfilled. Furthermore, it is one of the best colleges in terms of
 engaging and serving the community.
