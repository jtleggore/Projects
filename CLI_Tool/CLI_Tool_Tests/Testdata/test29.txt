University of Pennsylvania
 Work hard, play hard! That’s life at Penn. Strengths - Great approachable 
 Professors, almost any class or activity you can think of, wonderful diversity, 
 beautiful campus. Lots of opportunities to study abroad. Greek life is active,
 but not necessary to have a rich social life. Tuition, room and board are 
 expensive but there’s lots of aid available. Highly recommended, but very
 competitive admission rate ( around 8% ). Suggest applying Early Decision if
 Penn’s your first choice ( 18% acceptance rate ).
