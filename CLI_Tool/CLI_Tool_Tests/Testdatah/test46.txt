Indiana State University
 ndiana State has an amazing campus. A lot of buildings are newly renovated, including 
 the dorms. I really like the newly built health science building because that is where my major
 is. Indiana State has an amazing Honors College. It provides so many opportunities. The Honors 
 College has a great staff that works with students closely to give them the highest level of 
 education. Honors College students have the first pick for classes, better dorms (your own 
 bathroom!), and access to really unique courses. The food court is amazing and it is also newly 
 renovated. One of my favorite things about campus is the commute to classes from the dorms
 because at most it will take you 15 minutes to get to class. Personally, this will make the 
 Winter months much easier for me! I canâ€™t wait to start at Indiana State in the fall!
