Penn State   
 I liked Penn State because of the wide variety of majors they provided each student
 with. I chose Penn State because after graduating, a Penn State degree will look 
 amazing on applications and because I have always had an interest in going to school
 there. Penn state is diverse and offers so many different clubs, classes, and 
 opportunities for anyone
