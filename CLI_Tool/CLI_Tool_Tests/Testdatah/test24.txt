University of Pittsburgh
 I love it here. I've only had great experiences with professors so far. There 
 is also help for anything you could possibly want, like tutoring, tech help,
 volunteer, jobs, and overall career fairs. I also love its location, being in 
 the city is awesome. With being a Pitt student you get free access to all buses, 
 so you can travel anywhere in the city for free. Everyone here is so nice, and
 really smart. Its nice that this school has a mix of being academically focuses,
 major research opportunities, fun sports, city-life, and students that want to go
 out and have a good time!
