University of Pittsburgh   
 The University of Pittsburgh is a great university for exploration. If you are 
 in search for diversity this school is definitely for you. However, the food
 on campus is not the best. The meal exchanges are a good option, but the eatery
 is not. The academics here are good; however, choosing the right professors is 
 vital. Your experience at this university can be very different depending on
 what classes and what professors you get. Making use of the resources that are 
 provided to you is the best way to get the most out of your experience here.
