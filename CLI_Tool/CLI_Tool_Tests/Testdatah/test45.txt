 Parking Nightmare for Commuters â€“ Campus parking is confusing. Some spots are pay-to-park at 
 nearby machines, they have numbers in the spaces. Other areas are for F-S-C, Faculty-Staff-
 Commuters, yet some get fines when they think the S stands for students and they park there
 without a pre-paid commuter pass that you obtain online.
