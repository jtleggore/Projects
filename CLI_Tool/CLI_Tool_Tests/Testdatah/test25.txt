University of Pittsburgh 
 I love the community of intelligent, creative, unique, and genuine students I am 
 surrounded by at the University of Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is collaborative 
 rather than competitive, and it fosters a true desire to learn. Our course 
 selections are wide and interesting; there are some really niche offerings that
 anybody would enjoy. For the most part, my professors have been engaging and
 passionate, however I have had a few here and there who were either poor lecturers
 or had overly high expectations compared to the lower quality of instruction they 
 provided. I think on-campus housing options could be slightly better, but I had a 
 good experience in my freshman year dorm. Food options have definitely been evolving
 for the better since the start of my time at Pitt!
