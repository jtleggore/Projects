Indiana University of Pennsylvania
 Classes are easy, too easy for me and I am not the smartest student. I had a professor tell me
 that he does not care how well I do in their class, he will get paid no matter what. A lot of
 professors seem to only care about their paycheck. There are only a select few who really care 
 about their students. There are a lot of courses offered which i like. Classes can be small or 
 large it varies.
