Slippery Rock University 
 Slippery Rock is an amazing school and has a lot to do, with plenty of clubs to join. The classes 
 vary from large (100+ students) to small (less than 20). The campus is beautiful. The food is 
 alright, and it doesn't offer a whole lot for vegetarians or vegans. The campus is extremely safe,
 and the parties are pretty crazy.
