Slippery Rock University
 Slippery Rock University provides students with opportunities that many other students
 going to a medium sized school wouldn’t. I have had the opportunity to study abroad over
 spring break multiple times, be involved in running my own research, and much more. You 
 can really find your niche at Slippery Rock University. I would change the fact that they 
 don’t have many scholarships and none of their graduate assistantships are not online. This 
 would be beneficial for students in online graduate school who don’t live in the state.
