Massachusetts Institute of Technology
I really like the collaboration that I have with other students, my professors,
 and my TAs/mentors. MIT has so many academic tutoring programs that I enjoy 
 attending. Also, I love the different independent research opportunities and clubs
 that I'm in. These really help me progress in my career development and give me some
 social time with others outside of class.
