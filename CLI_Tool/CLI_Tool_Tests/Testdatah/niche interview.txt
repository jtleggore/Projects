 
 Slippery Rock University
 Slippery Rock University provides students with opportunities that many other students
 going to a medium sized school wouldn’t. I have had the opportunity to study abroad over
 spring break multiple times, be involved in running my own research, and much more. You 
 can really find your niche at Slippery Rock University. I would change the fact that they 
 don’t have many scholarships and none of their graduate assistantships are not online. This 
 would be beneficial for students in online graduate school who don’t live in the state.
 
 The campus is the perfect balance between small and large, spreading out its buildings in a
 sensical way. I'll be living in the apartments on-campus soon, though, and they're farthest
 away from the center of campus: do not like that.
 
 I really liked the atmosphere of the school when I toured. All of the faculty, staff, and 
 students seemed really outgoing, friendly, and open-minded. They accept all types of students 
 and personalities to campus, leading to an inclusive and intellectually-engaging education.
 
 Diversity on campus is very good. There are students of color and students that are white.
 There are also many foreign students. It opens up people's eyes to see that there is more out
 there than just where they grew up. I grew up in a little bubble of Neshannock High School 
 and the diversity here has helped me a lot.
 
 The campus was absolutely beautiful and the overall student environment is amazing. The sports
 teams are all very supportive of one another.
 
 Slippery Rock is an amazing school and has a lot to do, with plenty of clubs to join. The classes 
 vary from large (100+ students) to small (less than 20). The campus is beautiful. The food is 
 alright, and it doesn't offer a whole lot for vegetarians or vegans. The campus is extremely safe,
 and the parties are pretty crazy.
 
 Resident halls are AMAZING. Newly done, each dorm has their own bathrooms, they have 4 people rooms
 with a living room and minni kitchen, hardwood floors, fridges, AC, AMAZING. Traditional halls might
 suck a little bit, but I hear they have the best time and the most fun. A ghost haunts North Hall so 
 that's kinda cool.
 
 Slippery Rock University has some of the best and most helpful professors I have ever met as this is 
 my second time around going to college. With the lowest tuition rates in the state and the value you
 get from learning from the current professors (if a student takes advantage of what they can learn) 
 is unmatched anywhere else. While Slippery Rock is not the biggest town, it is only about an hour 
 from Pittsburgh and 1/2 an hour from Butler where more shopping, restaurants, and fun exist. 
 Slippery Rock University is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to improve their knowledge
 and success in life!
 
 Indiana University of Pennsylvania
 Classes are easy, too easy for me and I am not the smartest student. I had a professor tell me
 that he does not care how well I do in their class, he will get paid no matter what. A lot of
 professors seem to only care about their paycheck. There are only a select few who really care 
 about their students. There are a lot of courses offered which i like. Classes can be small or 
 large it varies.
 
 If you are from the area, than IUP may be the school for you. If you are not anywhere near the 
 Pittsburgh area, than i strongly encourage you to look for another school. Most people go home
 on the weekends since 85% of the freshman class are from the suburbs of Pittsburgh. The people 
 here kinda suck. The parties here are boring and trashy. The frats are rude and the sororities 
 are trashy. The professors never know what they are talking about ( no wonder why the tuition
 is so cheap). Even though the tuition is cheap, which is what attracts most people, it is not 
 worth coming here to further your academic career. Most professors are very un-professional 
 and you will question how they received a college degree. Don't make the mistake that I did 
 by choosing IUP as your school.
 
 Parking Nightmare for Commuters – Campus parking is confusing. Some spots are pay-to-park at 
 nearby machines, they have numbers in the spaces. Other areas are for F-S-C, Faculty-Staff-
 Commuters, yet some get fines when they think the S stands for students and they park there
 without a pre-paid commuter pass that you obtain online.
 
 Indiana State University
 ndiana State has an amazing campus. A lot of buildings are newly renovated, including 
 the dorms. I really like the newly built health science building because that is where my major
 is. Indiana State has an amazing Honors College. It provides so many opportunities. The Honors 
 College has a great staff that works with students closely to give them the highest level of 
 education. Honors College students have the first pick for classes, better dorms (your own 
 bathroom!), and access to really unique courses. The food court is amazing and it is also newly 
 renovated. One of my favorite things about campus is the commute to classes from the dorms
 because at most it will take you 15 minutes to get to class. Personally, this will make the 
 Winter months much easier for me! I can’t wait to start at Indiana State in the fall!
 
 Nice campus. Everything is pretty close. Good walking distance between classes. Diverse but
 has changed over the years. Dorks are outdated expect for the towers. Professors act as if
 they’re willing to work with you but don’t.
 
 Penn State Harrisburg
 Save your money for a college more worth while. This place doesn't care about the safety or 
 well-being of anyone but those in their interests. If you need campus police, good luck,
 they're "busy" and when you see them on campus, they're literally just hanging out. If you're 
 looking for a party scene, go somewhere else. This small campus is in a residential neighborhood 
 and is nothing like main campus. But, if you want to be awakened in the middle of the night to
 screaming and other loud noises, the dorms here are where it's at. If you're looking for quality 
 education, this place is a joke. They care more about pushing agendas than they do educating you 
 in what you're paying for. If you don't want to be just another number and want more of a 
 personalized approach, definitely go somewhere else. This place sucks.
 
 I have had a great experience at Penn State Harrisburg. There are many opportunities and resources
 for students such as tutors, counseling, office hours from professors, health assistance and much more.
 The professors really want to help you succeed by answering questions in and out of class, as well as
 taking time out of their day to make sure you understand what you're learning. Also, there is a library
 where you can study, find books/information, and librarians that can help find the right book for what
 you need. Not only does Penn State Harrisburg want to improve learning, they also want you to improve
 physically. This is why there is a gym where you can workout, different courts to play games on and even
 a pool. When you do not want to work on your mental and/or physical health there are events being held 
 throughout the year to help you relax and have fun. There is also areas around campus that have games for 
 down time. Overall, Penn State Harrisburg has great opportunities.
 
 Harrisburg Area Community College - Harrisburg
I really enjoyed being able to choose to have such a flexible schedule when enrolling in upcoming semester
 classes. I love the fact that there are not just college degree options offered, but continuing education
 credit hours and certificates are some of the many options as well! This college also has many articulation 
 and continuing education programs; meaning a lot of Bachelor's level colleges will take HACC credits and 
 ensures smooth transfers, wile saving thousands of dollars! Harrisburg Area Community College is affordable,
 local, and a wonderful opportunity overall for many adults of all ages to jumpstart their careers and 
 education! I do not see a need to make any changes at this time.
 
 Louisiana State University - Shreveport (Grad)
 I am currently a 1st year graduate student enrolled in the 100% online program. I have really enjoyed my 
 experience at LSUS so far. I feel really supported there and I also feel like, besides changes and
 interruptions due to COVID, everyone responds pretty quickly to questions and concerns.
