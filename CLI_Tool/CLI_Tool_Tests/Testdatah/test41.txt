Slippery Rock University 
 Resident halls are AMAZING. Newly done, each dorm has their own bathrooms, they have 4 people rooms
 with a living room and minni kitchen, hardwood floors, fridges, AC, AMAZING. Traditional halls might
 suck a little bit, but I hear they have the best time and the most fun. A ghost haunts North Hall so 
 that's kinda cool.
