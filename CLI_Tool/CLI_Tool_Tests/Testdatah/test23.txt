Pittsburg State University
I enjoy my program a lot here at Pitt, I do not enjoy the town. It is a fairly 
country town and that means that their are a lot of people who are not very
 accepting. It is also a bit of a party school which is not what I am after
 because of this COVID ran rampant first semester because there were many
 parties and campus as well as the community were not doing anything about
 this. There are also many people in the area who have yet to vaccinated even
 when the school provided free vaccinations. My main issues are with the 
 community and the area but so far I have loved most of my professors!
