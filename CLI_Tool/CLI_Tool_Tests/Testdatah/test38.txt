Slippery Rock University 
 Diversity on campus is very good. There are students of color and students that are white.
 There are also many foreign students. It opens up people's eyes to see that there is more out
 there than just where they grew up. I grew up in a little bubble of Neshannock High School 
 and the diversity here has helped me a lot.
