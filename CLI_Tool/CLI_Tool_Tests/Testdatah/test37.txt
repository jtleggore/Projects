Slippery Rock University 
 I really liked the atmosphere of the school when I toured. All of the faculty, staff, and 
 students seemed really outgoing, friendly, and open-minded. They accept all types of students 
 and personalities to campus, leading to an inclusive and intellectually-engaging education.
